    "<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2>--- Day 6: Guard Gallivant ---</h2><p>The Historians use their fancy <a href=\"4\">device</a> again, this time to whisk you all away to the North Pole prototype suit manufacturing lab... in the year <a href=\"/2018/day/5\">1518</a>! It turns out that having direct access to history is very convenient for a group of historians.</p>\n",
    "<p>You still have to be careful of time paradoxes, and so it will be important to avoid anyone from 1518 while The Historians search for the Chief. Unfortunately, a single <em>guard</em> is patrolling this part of the lab.</p>\n",
    "<p>Maybe you can work out where the guard will go ahead of time so that The Historians can search safely?</p>\n",
    "<p>You start by making a map (your puzzle input) of the situation. For example:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>....#.....\n",
    ".........#\n",
    "..........\n",
    "..#.......\n",
    ".......#..\n",
    "..........\n",
    ".#..^.....\n",
    "........#.\n",
    "#.........\n",
    "......#...\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>The map shows the current position of the guard with <code>^</code> (to indicate the guard is currently facing <em>up</em> from the perspective of the map). Any <em>obstructions</em> - crates, desks, alchemical reactors, etc. - are shown as <code>#</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Lab guards in 1518 follow a very strict patrol protocol which involves repeatedly following these steps:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>If there is something directly in front of you, turn right 90 degrees.</li>\n",
    "<li>Otherwise, take a step forward.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>Following the above protocol, the guard moves up several times until she reaches an obstacle (in this case, a pile of failed suit prototypes):</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>....#.....\n",
    "....^....#\n",
    "..........\n",
    "..#.......\n",

    ".#........\n",
    "........#.\n",
    "#.........\n",
    "......#...\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Because there is now an obstacle in front of the guard, she turns right before continuing straight in her new facing direction:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>....#.....\n",
    "........&gt;#\n",
    "..........\n",

    ".#........\n",
    "........#.\n",
    "#.........\n",
    "......#...\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Reaching another obstacle (a spool of several <em>very</em> long polymers), she turns right again and continues downward:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>....#.....\n",
    ".........#\n",
    "..........\n",
    "..#.......\n",
    ".......#..\n",
    "..........\n",
    ".#......v.\n",
    "........#.\n",
    "#.........\n",
    "......#...\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>This process continues for a while, but the guard eventually leaves the mapped area (after walking past a tank of universal solvent):</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>....#.....\n",
    ".........#\n",
    "..........\n",
    "..#.......\n",
    ".......#..\n",
    "..........\n",
    ".#........\n",
    "........#.\n",
    "#.........\n",
    "......#v..\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>By predicting the guard's route, you can determine which specific positions in the lab will be in the patrol path. <em>Including the guard's starting position</em>, the positions visited by the guard before leaving the area are marked with an <code>X</code>:</p>\n",

    "#XXXXXXX..\n",
    "......#X..\n",
