After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the <a href=\"/2019/day/10\">Ceres monitoring station</a>!</p>\n",
    "<p>As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her <em>word search</em> (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: <code>XMAS</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of <code>XMAS</code> - you need to find <em>all of them</em>.
